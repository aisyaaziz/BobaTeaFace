Installation guide

Guide to run the code: 
1. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to pull a project from GitHub to Visual Studio and run it using C# ASP.NET
2. Open Visual Studio and click on "File" -> "Open" -> "Project/Solution"
3. In the "Open Project" dialog box, navigate to the location where you want to clone the project, and then click "Clone a repository" -> "GitHub"
4. Enter the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone and click "Clone"
5. Visual Studio will prompt you to sign in to GitHub if you still need to do so. Enter your GitHub credentials and click "Sign In"
6. Once signed in, you'll see a list of repositories associated with your GitHub account. Select the repository you want to clone and click "Clone"
7. Visual Studio will download the repository and create a local copy on your machine. Once the process is complete, the project will be opened in Visual Studio.
8. Before running the project, restore any missing NuGet packages that the project might need. Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and click "Manage NuGet Packages". In the "NuGet Package Manager" window, click "Restore" to download and install any missing packages.
9. Now you can run the project by pressing F5 or by clicking on "Debug" -> "Start Debugging" from the top menu. This will build and launch the project in your default browser.
10. If you encounter any build errors, check the error message and try to resolve the issue. Sometimes, missing dependencies or incorrect configuration settings can cause build errors.

That's it! You should now be able to pull a project from GitHub to Visual Studio and run it using C# ASP.NET.
